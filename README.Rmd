Generate and post workouts as a issue to a GitHub repo. 

> Note: obviously I'm neither a profesional athlete (in case you haven't met me before), nor a professional trainer, so in case this needs to be said, please use these for "fun" workout, and with care (and of course at your own risk).

```{r}
library(worrkout)
cat(generate_workout(6))

  generate_workout(12),
